why does a counting sort require a range?
why can't we use a hash to keep track of all the counts the frequencies with a hash object and then iterate the hash and returin the frequencies in order

in an array of sub arrays where the sub array holds the key value pairs, can you first sort all sub arrays by value and then sort the value ties by key?
