// problem 1
print all the values in a linked list

Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 
console.log -> 
1
2
3
4


// problem 2
203. Remove Linked List Elements
Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.

Example
Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6, val = 6
Return: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5


// problem 3
234. Palindrome Linked List
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Follow up:
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?


// problem 4
160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


// problem 5
83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.


// problem 6
21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
