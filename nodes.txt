Alvin,


Thank you so much for speaking with me today.

I really appreciate your insights into the industry and perspectives on teaching.

Being at the beginning of my interviewing stage I felt a little bit jittery.

I just wanted to assure you that once I hit my comfort zone I really do enjoy leading the classroom.

It was really great to speak with someone who has a passion for exceptional learning materials and the learning process!


Thanks again,

Nate




Hello Noah,

I wanted to thank you for hosting the Job Hunt Meetup on Tuesday. 

I really got a lot out of your strategies and admire your energy for helping others.

Today I had an interview with App academy, it went well, but I don't feel like I absolutely nailed the confidence part.

Anyway, I found a job a few days ago that fits my current situation so perfectly I am hesitant to proceed.

I really don't want to botch the approach for landing it.

I think your services might be really beneficial for this exact situation.

Let me know if you are willing to take this on.
