Recursion

  what is it?

  Recursion is a where a function calles itself
  Key feature of recursion is that there must be a base case
  When using recursion you also must pay close attention to the call stack

  what happens if you don't have a base case?
    You will keep adding a requst to the call stack until you run out of memory and the stack overflows

  recursion is often used with deeply nested objects


  helper method recursion

    a recursive function inside of a recursive function 
      that takes a copy (slice()) of the original array and mutates it through recursion
      see cs_practice_problems/helper_method_recursion.js
